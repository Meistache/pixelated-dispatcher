Description: Pixelated-dispatcher dispatches between multiple pixelated user-agents
 Run multiple single user web apps on a server
 .
 pixelated-dispatcher allows you to run multiple instances of an application that had been designed for a single user.
 One example is to run multiple [pixelated-user-agents](https://github.com/pixelated-project/pixelated-user-agent) or [Mailpile](http://github.com/pagekite/Mailpile.git) instances (agents) on a server,
 hence the name pixelated-dispatcher.
 Aside from managing the different instances it also provides a login form to restrict access to individual agents.
 .
 The Pixelated Dispatcher is still in early development state!**
 .
 Hence the setup is sometimes still less straight forward then expected.
 You will find more details as you go through this README.
